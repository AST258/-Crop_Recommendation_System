# Crop_Recommendation_System
Overview
This project aims to design and implement a machine learning model for precision agriculture that predicts the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various environmental parameters including soil content (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall. The goal is to maximize agricultural yield by recommending optimal crop types tailored to the specific conditions of individual farms.

Key Tasks
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features.
Feature Selection: Identify the most influential features for crop prediction using techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance ranking.
Model Definition: Explore and evaluate different machine learning algorithms suitable for multi-class classification to predict crop types.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed dataset, utilizing techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following fields:

N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil
temperature: Temperature in degree Celsius
humidity: Relative humidity in percentage
ph: pH value of the soil
rainfall: Rainfall in mm
Label: Type of crop
